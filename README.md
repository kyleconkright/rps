#Paper Rock Scissors
See working game [here](http://kyleconkright.github.io/rps/)

A simple javascript version of a classic game. First to five wins. Logic used to display different messages when the game ends.

Play with clicks or keyboard shortcuts. `R` for Rock, `P` for Paper, and you guessed it `S` for Scissors.
